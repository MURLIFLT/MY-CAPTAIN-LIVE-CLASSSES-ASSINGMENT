#Python Strings
#You can use double or single quotes:

print("Hello")
print('Hello')

#Assign String to a Variable
a = "Hello"
print(a)

#Multiline Strings

#Or three single quotes
a = '''welcome to patna.'''
print(a)

'''Strings are Arrays
Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.'''

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[5])

'''Looping Through a String
Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.'''


for x in "cpu":
  print(x)
  
'''  String Length
To get the length of a string, use the len() function.'''


a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))


'''Check String
To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.'''


txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)

#Use it in an if statement:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'free' is present.")
  
'''Check if NOT
To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.'''

'''txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt)'''


txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
  print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")

#Python - Slicing Strings

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])


'''Slice From the Start
By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:'''

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])

'''Slice To the End
By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:'''
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])

#Negative Indexing
#Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])

#Python - Modify Strings
#Upper Case

a = "Hello, guys!"

#Lower Case

'''Remove Whitespace
Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.'''
a = " Hello, chiiti! "
print(a.strip()) 

#Replace String

a = "Hello, boy!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))

'''Split String
The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.'''


a = "Hello, mumbai!"
print(a.split(",")) 

'''String Concatenation
To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.'''

a = "Hello"
b = "prerna"
c = a + b
print(c)

a = "hello"
b = "saniya"
